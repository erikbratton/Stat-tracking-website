# Stat-tracking-website

Project Description:
Statistic Tracker is a web application designed to centralize and display sports statistics for my group of friends. I created this project to make it easy to view stats from multiple sports in one place, while also focusing on making it visually appealing.
You can mainly see this in my first page, this has several images of my friends with transitions to make the website more appealing. This also helped me to experiment with CSS styling.

The project leverages Node.js for server-side logic, EJS for rendering dynamic HTML, and MongoDB for storing player statistics. The application allows users to track wins, losses, and win percentages for different sports, including volleyball and spikeball. Players can be dynamically selected for different match setups (2v2, 3v3, 4v4), and new stats can be updated and saved live as games are completed.

Technologies Used: 
Node.js for server-side development
Expres to simplify server-side development
MongoDB for database management
JavaScript for dynamic frontend interactivity
EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for rendering views
HTML/CSS for designing the user interface
Features: 
Centralized stats tracker for multiple sports
Real-time updating of stats as users submit game results
Support for multiple match types (e.g., 2v2, 3v3)
A clean, easy-to-navigate interface with player drop-down menus
Challenges and Future Enhancements: 
One of the challenges faced during development was dynamically rendering player selections for varying match sizes (2v2, 3v3, etc.).
In the future, I plan to implement user authentication so players can view their individual stats and performance history.
